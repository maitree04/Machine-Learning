# Machine-Learning
1.To use PCA Algorithm for dimensionality reduction.
You have a dataset that includes measurements for different variables on wine
(alcohol, ash, magnesium, and so on). Apply PCA algorithm & transform this data
so that most variations in the measurements of the variables are captured by a small
number of principal components so that it is easier to distinguish between red and
white wine by inspecting these principal components.

2.Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off
location. Perform following tasks:
  1. Pre-process the dataset.
  2. Identify outliers.
  3. Check the correlation.
  4. Implement linear regression and ridge, Lasso regression models.
  5. Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

3.Implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying images of handwritten digits into their respective numerical classes (0 to 9).

4.Implement K-Means clustering on Iris.csv dataset. Determine the number of clusters
using the elbow method.
